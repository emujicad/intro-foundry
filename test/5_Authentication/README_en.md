# Wallet Contract Tests (Wallet.t.sol)

This Solidity contract (`Wallet.t.sol`) contains the unit tests for the `Wallet.sol` contract. It uses the Foundry testing framework to verify the ownership change functionality and access control of the wallet contract. It's a key example for understanding how to test security and permissions in smart contracts.

## Key Features

*   **Test Setup (`setUp`)**: Deploys a new instance of the `Wallet` contract before each test.
*   **Owner Change Test**: Verifies that the `changeOwner()` function correctly updates the owner's address.
*   **Non-Owner Failure Test**: Checks that the `changeOwner()` function reverts when called by an address that is not the current owner.
*   **`msg.sender` Simulation**: Uses `vm.prank()` to simulate calls from different addresses.
*   **Debugging with `console.log`**: Shows how to use `console.log` to inspect `msg.sender` and the contract owner during tests.

## Solidity and Foundry Concepts to Learn

*   **`pragma solidity ^0.8.24;`**: Defines the Solidity compiler version.
*   **`import "forge-std/Test.sol";`**: Imports Foundry's standard test library.
*   **`import "../src/Wallet.sol";`**: Imports the `Wallet` contract to be tested.
*   **`contract WalletTest is Test { ... }`**: Declaration of the test contract, inheriting from `Test`.
*   **`setUp()`**: Special function executed before each test to set up the environment.
*   **`vm.prank(address account);`**: Foundry cheat code to simulate that the next function call comes from the specified `account`. It's crucial for testing access control.
*   **`vm.expectRevert("error message");`**: Cheat code to expect the next function call to revert with a specific error message.
*   **`assertEq(expected, actual, "error message");`**: Assertion function to check if two values are equal.
*   **`msg.sender`**: Global variable representing the address that initiated the current transaction.
*   **`console.log(...)`**: Foundry debugging function to print information to the console.

## How the Tests Work

1.  **`setUp()`**: Deploys a new instance of the `Wallet` contract. The `msg.sender` that deploys the test contract (`WalletTest`) becomes the initial owner of the `Wallet` contract.
2.  **`test_changeOwner()`**:
    *   Defines a `newOwner` address.
    *   Calls `wallet.changeOwner(newOwner)` from the `WalletTest` (which is the initial owner).
    *   Verifies with `assertEq` that the `Wallet` contract's owner has been correctly updated to `newOwner`.
3.  **`test_failNotOwner()`**:
    *   Uses `vm.prank(address(0x00000124))` to simulate that the next call comes from an address other than the owner.
    *   Uses `vm.expectRevert("Error: Only owner can change owner")` to expect the `changeOwner()` call to fail with the specific error message.
    *   Calls `wallet.changeOwner()` from the simulated "non-owner" address, confirming that the access restriction works.

## Usage (Running Tests)

To run these tests, you will need to have Foundry installed. Navigate to your project's root directory and run:

```bash
forge test
```

Foundry will compile the contracts and execute all test functions. The results will indicate whether the tests passed or failed, helping you verify the access control logic of your `Wallet` contract.

This test contract is an essential resource for learning how to test security and permissions in Solidity, critical skills for building robust and reliable smart contracts.
