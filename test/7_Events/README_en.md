# Event Tests (Events.t.sol)

This Solidity contract (`Events.t.sol`) contains the unit tests for the `CEvents.sol` contract, which demonstrates how to emit and verify events on the blockchain. It uses the Foundry testing framework, which provides powerful tools like `vm.expectEmit()` to ensure that events are emitted correctly with the expected data.

## Key Features

*   **Event Emission Verification**: Demonstrates how to use `vm.expectEmit()` to test that a specific event has been emitted.
*   **Single Event Test**: Verifies the emission of a single event with `transferOnce()`.
*   **Multiple Events Test**: Checks the emission of multiple events within a loop with `transferMany()`.
*   **Indexed and Non-Indexed Parameter Matching**: Shows how `vm.expectEmit()` can be configured to selectively check indexed parameters (topics) and non-indexed data of an event.

## Solidity and Foundry Concepts to Learn

*   **`pragma solidity ^0.8.24;`**: Defines the Solidity compiler version.
*   **`import "forge-std/Test.sol";`**: Imports Foundry's standard test library.
*   **`import "../src/Events.sol";`**: Imports the `CEvents` contract to be tested.
*   **`contract EventsTest is Test { ... }`**: Declaration of the test contract, inheriting from `Test`.
*   **`event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount);`**: Re-declaration of the `Transfer` event in the test contract. This is crucial for `vm.expectEmit()` to correctly match the event.
*   **`setUp()`**: Special function executed before each test to set up the environment, in this case, deploying a new instance of `CEvents`.
*   **`vm.expectEmit(checkTopic1, checkTopic2, checkTopic3, checkData);`**: Foundry cheat code to expect an event emission.
    *   The first three booleans (`checkTopic1`, `checkTopic2`, `checkTopic3`) indicate whether to check the `indexed` parameters of the event.
    *   `checkData` indicates whether to check the non-indexed parameters.
*   **`emit EventName(param1, param2, ...);`**: In the context of `vm.expectEmit()`, this line "pre-emits" the expected event. Foundry captures this and compares it with the actual event emitted by the function being tested.

## How the Tests Work

1.  **`setUp()`**: Deploys a new instance of the `CEvents` contract.
2.  **`testEmitTransferOnce()`**:
    *   Sets up `vm.expectEmit()` to expect a `Transfer` event matching the `from`, `to` (indexed), and `amount` (non-indexed) parameters.
    *   Calls `cevents.transferOnce()`, which should emit the expected event.
    *   The process is repeated with different parameters to demonstrate flexibility.
3.  **`testEmitTransferMany()`**:
    *   Prepares arrays of addresses and amounts.
    *   Within a loop, sets up `vm.expectEmit()` for each individual `Transfer` event that `transferMany()` is expected to emit.
    *   Calls `cevents.transferMany()`, and Foundry verifies that all expected events are emitted in the correct order.

## Uso (Ejecuci√≥n de Pruebas)

To run these tests, you will need to have Foundry installed. Navigate to your project's root directory and run:

```bash
forge test
```

Foundry will compile the contracts and execute all test functions. The results will indicate whether the tests passed or failed, helping you verify the event emission logic of your `CEvents` contract.

This test contract is an essential resource for learning how to test event emission in Solidity, a crucial skill for building decentralized applications that effectively interact with the blockchain.
