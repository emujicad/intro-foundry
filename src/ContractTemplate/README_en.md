# Empty Template Contract (Planilla.sol)

This Solidity contract (`Planilla.sol`) is a basic, empty smart contract. It serves as a starting point or a template for future development. Although it currently contains no logic or variables, it is an example of the minimum structure required for a Solidity contract.

## Key Features

*   **Empty Contract**: Contains no functions or state variables.
*   **Basic Template**: Can be extended to implement any business logic.

## Solidity Concepts to Learn

*   **`pragma solidity ^0.8.24;`**: Defines the Solidity compiler version.
*   **`contract Planilla { ... }`**: The fundamental structure for declaring a smart contract in Solidity. All contract code is written within these curly braces.

## Purpose and Usage

This contract is useful for:

*   **Starting a New Project**: Provides a clean base to begin writing a new smart contract.
*   **Understanding Basic Structure**: Helps beginners visualize the simplest form of a Solidity contract.
*   **Placeholder**: Can be used as a placeholder in a larger project, indicating that a contract with this name is planned to be implemented later.

## How to Extend It

To make this contract functional, the following elements can be added:

*   **State Variables**: To store data on the blockchain (e.g., `uint256 public myNumber;`).
*   **Functions**: To define the logic and actions the contract can perform (e.g., `function doSomething() public { ... }`).
*   **Events**: To communicate contract actions to external applications.
*   **Custom Errors**: For efficient error handling.
*   **Modificadores**: To control access to functions.

This contract is a blank canvas for any developer looking to build on the Ethereum blockchain.
