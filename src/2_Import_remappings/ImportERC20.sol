contract Token is ERC20("CoinTest", "CTK", 18) {}
// This declares a new smart contract named 'Token'.
// 'is ERC20("CoinTest", "CTK", 18)' means that 'Token' contract inherits from the 'ERC20' contract.
// When inheriting, the constructor of the base contract (ERC20 in this case) is called.
// Here, it's calling the ERC20 constructor with:
// - "CoinTest": The name of the token.
// - "CTK": The symbol of the token.
// - 18: The number of decimal places for the token.
// By inheriting from ERC20, the 'Token' contract automatically gets all the standard ERC-20 functionalities
// like `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`, and their corresponding events.
// This makes it very easy to create a new ERC-20 compliant token.
