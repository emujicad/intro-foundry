    // This declares a new smart contract named 'forkDai'.
    // This contract is a placeholder, meaning it's a basic structure intended to be expanded upon.
    // It's designed to represent a "forked" version of the Dai stablecoin,
    // often used in development or testing environments to simulate the behavior of a real token.

    // It can be extended with functionalities specific to the Dai token
    // or used as a base for creating a new token with similar properties.

    // This declares a public state variable 'name' of type 'string'.
    // 'string' is used for text data.
    // 'public' means this variable can be read by anyone from outside the contract.
    // It stores the name of this token, which is "Forked Dai Token".

    string public symbol = "fDAI";
    // This declares a public state variable 'symbol' of type 'string'.

    // This is a common practice for cryptocurrencies (e.g., ETH for Ethereum, BTC for Bitcoin).

    uint8 public decimals = 18;
    // This declares a public state variable 'decimals' of type 'uint8'.
    // 'uint8' is an unsigned integer that can store values from 0 to 255.
    // 'decimals' indicates how many decimal places the token uses.
    // For many ERC-20 tokens, including Dai, 18 decimals is standard.
    // This means that 1 token is represented as 1 * (10 ** 18) in its smallest unit.

    // Additional functionalities can be added here as needed
    // For a full token, you would typically add functions for:
    // - `totalSupply()`: To get the total number of tokens in existence.
    // - `balanceOf(address account)`: To get the balance of a specific address.
    // - `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: To send tokens to another address.
    // - `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`: To allow another address to spend tokens on your behalf.
    // - `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: To transfer tokens from one address to another (after approval).
    // These functions are part of the ERC-20 standard, which defines a common interface for fungible tokens on Ethereum.
